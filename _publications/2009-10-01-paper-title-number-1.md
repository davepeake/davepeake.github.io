Time resolved experiments require precision timing equipment and careful configuration of the machine and the beamline. The Australian Synchrotron has a state of the art timing system that allows flexible, real-time control of the machine and beamline timing parameters to target specific electron bunches. Results from a proof-of-principle measurement with a pulsed laser and a streak camera on the optical diagnostic beamline will be presented. The timing system was also used to fast trigger the PILATUS detector on an x-ray beamline to measure the fill pattern dependent effects of the detector. PILATUS was able to coarsely measure the fill pattern in the storage ring which implies that fill pattern intensity variations need to be corrected for when using the detector in this mode.
