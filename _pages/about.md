Passionate about Health Equity
==============================
Pneumonia is the [largest infectous killer of children world-wide](https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9280640489/en/), killing over 880,000 children under 5 each year. The burden of pneumonia is disproportionality heavy in low-to-middle income countries. 

**Oxygen is a life-saving treatment for pneumonia.**

Co-founding [FREO<sub>2</sub> Foundation Australia](https://www.freo2.org) in 2016, I am driven by the belief that **Every health facility that cares for
in-patients must have oxygen.**

Many solutions that work in high-resource environments are just not appropriate in these areas due to logistics, cost and electricity availability. FREO<sub>2</sub> creates novel, appropriate technologies to increase oxygen access to those that need it the most.

Expert in Data Acquisition and Analysis
=======================================
Since completing my PhD in Accelerator Physics in 2012, I have used my experience in experimental design to solve problems in industry and research settings. From small accelerometer loggers measuring glass vibrations to electronics correcting detector non-linearities in a GMP facility, I have supplied industry with high-tech, rapidly deployed solutions.

As part of my work with FREO<sub>2</sub>, I have designed many bespoke data acquisition systems. These have been constructed to provide real-time data access proving our innovations *in-situ*.
